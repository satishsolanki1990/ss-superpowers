# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute all tasks, report when complete.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

**Note:** If subagents are available (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Codex App, Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI — see `../using-superpowers/references/`), use superpowers:subagent-driven-development instead.

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Ensure an isolated workspace: use superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create one or verify the existing one
2. Read plan file
3. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
4. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
5. If no concerns: Create todos for the plan items and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Tasks

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing when:**
- Hit a blocker (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- Never start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent
